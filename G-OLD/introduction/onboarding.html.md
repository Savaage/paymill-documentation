The on-boarding process with PAYMILL differs slightly depending upon the combination of payment methods selected by the merchant.

In this guide, we'll cover the three main methods, credit card, PayPal & ELV.

To begin the process, you first need to [sign up for a PAYMILL account](https://app.paymill.com/user/register). You will receive separate instructions depending upon the payment methods you selected, as they can all be switched on at different times.

## Credit and debit card

### Getting started

To accept **live** credit & debit card transactions via your website or app, you will need to complete the [activation form](https://app.paymill.com/settings/activation).

Select all the relevant payment methods that you require, and complete the rest of the activation form as fully as possible.

### What do I need to provide?

To be able to accept **live** transactions, we need to know a certain amount of information about you, and your business.

You will receive an email for each payment method selected shortly after submitting the activation form with the next steps required, and a request for any further documentation we may need.

As a part of this step, you will also receive a service agreement, which you must sign and [upload](https://app.paymill.com/settings/documents) along with the other requested documentation.

### Next steps

Once we have received this information from you, we pass this onto our partner acquiring bank and begin the process of opening a merchant account on your behalf. A part of this process is carrying out due diligence to protect our merchants.

Once the account has been successfully opened, you will receive an email informing you of this, and a separate email with your live API keys.

You will receive a confirmation email for each payment method that you selected in the activation form.

## PayPal

### Getting started

To use PayPal via a PAYMILL account, you will need an activated business PayPal account before trying to process a **live** transaction.

To get started with PayPal, simply visit their [website](https://www.paypal.com) and follow the instructions on there.

### What do I need to provide?

Once you've signed up for your PAYMILL account, you will first need to navigate to the [activation form](https://app.paymill.com/settings/activation).

From here you will need to select PayPal as a payment method, and complete the rest of the activation form.

Upon submitting your activation form, you will receive an email for each payment method that you have selected (e.g. credit & debit cards, PayPal and ELV), explaining the next steps.

You will also receive a service agreement, which you must sign and [upload](https://app.paymill.com/settings/documents) before you will be able to process live PayPal transactions.

### Next steps

Once we have received the signed service agreement back from you, we will activate your PAYMILL account to be able to connect with your PayPal account. You will receive an email informing you when this process has been completed.
