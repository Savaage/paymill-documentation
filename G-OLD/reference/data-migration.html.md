Our goal is enable you to migrate to PAYMILL as easy and fast as possible. Therefore we offer you a convenient and secure data transfer - for free.

## 1. Process description

This describes in which format the credit card information is transferred from a third PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDER (PSP) to PAYMILL. The reason why data is moved is because a merchant is switching from his old PSP to the PAYMILL platform.

Credit card data from a third party PSP shall be imported to the PAYMILL platform. Reason is the switch of a merchant from one PSP to the PAYMILL platform. In order to enable the merchant to use the stored card information from the old PSP, the card data need to be imported to PAYMILL. The card data shall be used for a later reference of payment transactions.

### General Requirements

**File format**

  - .csv file with naming convention for the filename
  - PGP encrypted

**Data transfer**

  - via SFTP to and from PAYMILL
  - Access to the SFTP requires whitelisting of IP addresses and login data which will be secure submitted

**Data type**

  - The data import include credit/debit card data, such as card number, card expiry date, account holder (optional), etc ...
  - From this data PAYMILL generates a token (=Registration) and a payment object which will be used for later reference by the merchant.
  - The import won't include transactions histories, such as previous debits.

**Limitation for number of transaction per file**

  - There's no limitation per file.


### Clarification of terms

**Transaction types generated from the imported data**

  - From the imported data PAYMILL will generate Tokens and payment objects for credit card / debit card

**Payments**

  - Refers to the generated payment object and the Token

**Payment object**

  - The Unique payment object is automatically created by PAYMILL for each imported data.
  - The payment object on PAYMILL side will be assigned to a automatic created client object during the migration. The merchant uses the Paymill client or payment object ID for future debits which reference on the client/ payment object. That means the shopper doesn't need to enter the card details anymore, but the system will use the stored card data from the payment object
  - Each newly generated payment object from the imported data will contain the old Creditcard information of the old PSP token.


### PCI

PAYMILL ([www.paymill.com](http://www.paymill.com)) and or his TPSP is PCI certified.

### Minimum data and format required for import

The third PSP should provide the data in a csv file including the following minimal values and format.

The filename should look like this format `[Channel_ID]_[Special_Merchant_ID]_[Number of file].csv`.

The **Channel_ID** is the Public LiveKey from the Merchant and can be found in the Settings of the Account in the Merchant Centre. The **Special_Merchant_ID** is an ID which is send via Mail to the PSP.

### Data mapping for exported data

Is made through the old token which matches with a new Payment object id and a client object id. All Data is linked to the PAYMILL Client Object which was automatically created through the migration script and is entered in the Export csv file.


PAYMILL creates the following .csv for you to map the new payment object ID and the client object ID with the old "token". This file will be delivered to you from our PAYMILL support.
